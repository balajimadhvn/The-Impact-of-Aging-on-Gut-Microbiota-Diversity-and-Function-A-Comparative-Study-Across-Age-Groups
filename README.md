# Gut Microbiota and Aging: A Metagenomic Comparative Study

This repository contains the datasets, analysis scripts, and visualizations from my thesis project titled:  
**"The Impact of Aging on Gut Microbiota Diversity and Function: A Comparative Study Across Age Groups."**

## 📘 Abstract
This study investigates how aging affects human gut microbiota composition and function across three age groups: young adults, middle-aged individuals, and older adults. Using metagenomic datasets from NCBI, we performed taxonomic classification, functional profiling, diversity analysis, and differential abundance assessment to uncover microbial shifts related to aging. Key tools used include QIIME2, Kraken2, HUMAnN3, PICRUSt2, and MetaSPAdes.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze gut microbial diversity across age groups.
- Perform taxonomic and functional profiling of gut microbiota.
- Identify age-associated shifts in microbial composition and function.
- Visualize and compare diversity metrics, phylogeny, and pathway abundance.

## 🧪 Tools and Technologies
- **QIIME 2 (v2023.2)** – Microbiome data analysis  
- **Kraken2 + Krona** – Taxonomic classification and interactive visualization  
- **PICRUSt2 + HUMAnN3** – Functional profiling of metagenomes  
- **MetaSPAdes** – Metagenomic assembly  
- **DADA2** – Amplicon denoising and ASV table creation  
- **ANCOM** – Differential abundance testing  
- **R + phyloseq + ggplot2 + vegan** – Statistical analysis and data visualization  
- **Python + Biopython** – Additional sequence analysis  
- **MultiQC** – Aggregate quality control reports


## 📈 Key Findings
- Older individuals showed decreased alpha diversity and compositional shifts in gut microbiota.
- Age-specific enrichment in taxa like **Spirochaetota** was observed in older adults.
- KEGG pathway analysis revealed functional changes in metabolism and immune pathways.
- NSTI and differential abundance metrics indicated reliable age-related microbial signatures.
